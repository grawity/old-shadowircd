This directory contains modules and patches that have been contributed
by other people, or aren't suitable for including into the 
ircd-ratbox tree.  The coding team do not officially support the contrib/ 
modules, or guarantee any of them will actually work.

Oh and running some of these on certain networks *cough*efnet*cough* really
isn't recommended.  Some of them(notably things that do evil stuff to
channels) could very well get your server delinked.  And these *really* are
not part of the official ircd-ratbox distribution, they are provided merely
for your ircd-hacking-network-exploding convenience.
