The Shadowircd coding group is a group of developers who were annoyed with 
the slowness of OpenIRCd. The original ircd was based on hybrid/6.3.1, 
with subsequent releases based on hybrid/6.4.1. All of the necessary 
compatibility code was added, and the ircd was ran through stackguard and 
purify to ensure reliability.

Now, The group maintains a very solid IRCd with many improvements over the 
original ircd used. As of this release, the coding team has expanded, with 
many new people and ideas.

As of present, the current ShadowIRCd coding team is (in nick-alphabetical 
order):

AsierDelcroath, Bagheera, Eko, Lunis, nenolod, NhJm.

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the project, as long as they are 
competant developers. Contact ircd@nenolod.net for more information.
