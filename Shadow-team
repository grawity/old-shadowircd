The Shadowircd coding group is a group of developers who were annoyed with 
the slowness of OpenIRCd. The original ircd was based on hybrid/6.3.1, 
with subsequent releases based on hybrid/6.4.1. All of the necessary 
compatibility code was added, and the ircd was ran through stackguard and 
purify to ensure reliability.

Now, The group maintains a very solid IRCd with many improvements over the 
original ircd used. As of this release, the coding team has expanded, with 
many new people and ideas.

The following people have provided contributions to the ircd:
