ShadowIRCd is the collaboration of many people's ideas.
The following people currently maintain the ShadowIRCd codebase:
 
nenolod                  nenolod@kpanic.org
Ashen                    l43x@mindspring.com

Some help has been provided by the following (testing etc.)

Zippoboy7                zippoboy7@criten.net
Lucifer7                 schultz200ca@hotmail.com
NhJm                     nhjm449@hotmail.com

As of 2.4.4, new methods of CIDR computation have been added.
This was written by AndroSyn, and the rest of the ratbox team.

For information concerning previous coders, see the Shadow-team file in
