Syntax: %bJUMP <server> [port]%b

Attempts to connect to <server> with [port].  <server> may
contain wildcards. <server> *must* have an S: line in
hybserv.conf.  If [port] is not specified, it uses the port
given in the server's S: line.  If HybServ is unable to
connect to <server>, it keeps the existing connection with
the current hub.
