Syntax: %bHTM [ON|OFF|MAX [rate]]%b

Displays high-traffic mode statistics.  If ON or OFF is
specified, forces high-traffic mode ON or OFF.  If MAX
is specified, services won't switch to HTM until the load
hits the specified rate.  While in high-traffic mode, the
hub server will be given priority over dcc/telnet clients etc.
Examples:
         %bHTM ON%b
           Forces high-traffic mode ON.

         %bHTM OFF%b
           Forces high-traffic mode OFF.

         %bHTM MAX 100%b
           Services won't switch to HTM until the load
           reaches 100 K/s.
