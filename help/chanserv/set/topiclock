Syntax: %bSET <channel> TOPICLOCK {ON|OFF}%b

If TOPICLOCK is ON, %C will not allow anyone
(except founders) to change the topic on <channel>.
The only way to change the topic with TOPICLOCK enabled
is %b/msg %C SET <channel> TOPIC <topic>%b. Type:
%b/msg %C HELP SET TOPIC%b for more information.
Alias: %bTLOCK%b
