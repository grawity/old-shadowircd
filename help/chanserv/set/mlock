Syntax: %bSET <channel> MLOCK <modes>%b

Causes %C to enforce <modes> for <channel>.  Modes
following a "+" are locked ON, while modes following
a "-" are locked OFF.
Alias: %bMODELOCK%b

Examples:
         %bSET #channel MLOCK -mi+sntl 6%b
           Modes 'm' and 'i' are not allowed to be set,
           while modes 's', 'n', and 't' are forced on.
           The channel limit will also always be set to
           6.

         %bSET #channel MLOCK +sk hello%b
           Mode 's' is forced on, and the channel key
           is forced to be "hello".

         %bSET #channel MLOCK +%b
           Removes all locks on modes, so any modes
           are free to be on/off.
