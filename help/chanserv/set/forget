Syntax: %bSET <channel> FORGET {ON}%b

When you toggle FORGET ON, %C will leave your channel,
and no one else will be able to register it or use it.
You will NOT be able to gain ops through %C, or
use any other %C functions if your channel is forgotten.
Its purpose is for those who do not wish to have a
%C in their channel, but still want to prevent others
from registering the channel.  The only way to "UN"FORGET
your channel is to %bDROP%b it.
