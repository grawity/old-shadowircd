Syntax: %bOP <channel | ALL> [nicknames]%b

Gives channel operator status to [nicknames].  If no
nicknames are specified, %C will op the nick who gave
the command.  Placing a %b-%b in front of a nick will
deop that nick.  If SECUREOPS is ON, %C will not
op nicks who do not have a level of AutoOp or higher.
Examples:
         %b/msg %C OP #channel%b
           Ops the nick who gave the command on #channel.

         %b/msg %C OP #channel nick1 -nick2 nick3%b
           Ops nick1 and nick3, but deops nick2 on #channel.

         %b/msg %C OP ALL%b
           Ops you in all channels you are currently in, if
          you have CMDOP access.
