Syntax: %bAKICK <channel> ADD [time] <hostmask> [reason]%b

Adds <hostmask> to the autokick list for <channel> with
[reason].  If you specify [time] the akick will expire after
that period of time, otherwise it will never expire.
You may not add an autokick entry that matches an access
level higher than your own on the channel. If there are matching
users on the channel, when the akick is added the users will be
banned kick.
