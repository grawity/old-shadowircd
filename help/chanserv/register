Syntax: %bREGISTER <channel> <password>%b

Registers <channel> in %C's database.  %b<password>%b
is needed so you may %bIDENTIFY%b at a later time to
change channel settings.  You must be a channel operator
on the channel you wish to register. Once you register
a channel, you will automatically be given founder
access, and be added to the %bACCESS%b list as a SuperOp.
You can give other channel members limited access to
your channel through the %bACCESS%b command (%b/msg %C%b
%bHELP ACCESS%b)

In order to register a channel, you must first register
your nickname with %N (%b/msg %N HELP REGISTER%b).
If the founder's nickname expires or is %bDROP%b'd, the
channel will also be dropped.  Also, if noone on the
channel's %bACCESS%b list enters the channel at least
once every two weeks, the channel will be automatically
dropped.
