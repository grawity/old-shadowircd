Syntax: %bFORWARD <index|ALL> <nick/channel>%b

Forwards a memo (or all memos) to the specified nickname or
channel.  The text "[Fwd]: " will be prepended to the memo
text so the recipient will know it was forwarded.  A channel
can be the recipient of a forwarded memo, but you cannot
forward a channel's memo(s) to another nick/channel.
Example: %bforward ALL my-pal%b
