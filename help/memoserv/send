Syntax: %bSEND <nick|channel> <text>%b

If the recipient is a nick, they will recieve a memo
containing <text>.  They will also recieve a notice
saying they have a new memo (as long as their NOTIFY is
ON).  If the recipient is a channel, all the autoops on
the channel will recieve a notice of the new memo.  You
must have autoop access or higher to send a memo to a
channel.
