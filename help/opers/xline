XLINE [time] <gecos> [type] :<reason>

Bans by gecos (aka 'real name') field.  If [time] is not specified
this is added to xline.conf, otherwise is temporary for [time] 
minutes.  If you need to, use ? in place of spaces in the <gecos>.

The type field denotes how the XLINE works and may be:
  0 - Send a warning to +r opers but allow user to connect.
  1 - Reject the user and send a warning to +r opers. (default)
  2 - Reject the user silently.

Eg. /quote xline eggdrop?bot 2 :no bots

The <gecos> field contains certain special characters:
  ? - Match any single character
  * - Many any characters
  @ - Match any letter [A-Za-z]
  # - Match any digit [0-9]

To use a literal one of these characters, escape it with '\'.  A 
literal '\' character must also be escaped.

If the <gecos> field is purely numeric (ie "123") then the time
field must be specified.  "0" must be used to denote a permanent 
numeric XLINE.

XLINE <gecos> <type> ON <server> :<reason>

Will attempt to set the XLINE on <server> if <server> accepts
remote xlines.  The <type> MUST be specified for a remote xline.

It is not possible to set temporary remote xlines.
