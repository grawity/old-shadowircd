Syntax: %bLINK <nickname> <password>%b

This command will link your current nickname to
<nickname>, assuming you have supplied the correct
password for <nickname>. Once you have linked nicknames,
your %bACCESS%b list will be deleted, and you will share
<nickname>'s access list. Your memos will also be added
to <nickname>'s memos. If <nickname> was previously
unlinked, it will become the master nickname for your
link.

When any nickname in your link gives a command to services,
it will be processed as if it came from the master nickname,
with the exception of %bDROP%b, %bUNLINK%b, %bSET PASSWORD%b,
%bSET EMAIL%b, and %bSET URL%b.

The advantage of linked nicknames is whenever you
%bIDENTIFY%b for one nick, you will be identified for
every nick in the link. Also, memos sent to any nickname
will all be stored in the master nickname's record, for
any nickname in the link to read. Furthermore, if any
nickname in the link is on a channel's access list, all
nicknames will receive the same access.

Example:
        %b/msg %N LINK CoolGuy CoolGuysPassword%b
          Links your nickname to "CoolGuy".
