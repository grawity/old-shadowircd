Syntax: %bFLAG <nickname> [flags]%b

This command allows administrators to maintain some control
over naughty users on their network. You can set various
flags for a user which will limit his/her services
privileges.
If <nickname> is in a nickname link, the restrictive
flags will affect all nicknames in the link.

Available Flags:

  %b-noregister%b  - Prevents user from registering any
                 channels.

  %b-nochanops%b   - ChanServ will not allow the user to
                 be opped on any registered channel.

  %b-clear%b       - Clear all current flags for the user.

Examples:
         %b/msg %N FLAG meanie -noreg -nochan%b
           The user "meanie" cannot register any channels,
           and cannot receive channel operator status in
           any registered channel - even if they are on
           the access list.

         %b/msg %N FLAG meanie -clear%b
           "meanie" has repented and is allowed to use
           services normally again.
