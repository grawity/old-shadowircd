Syntax: %bGHOST <nickname> [password]%b

If you suddenly get disconnected from your isp or
the irc server, sometimes a ghosted client will
be left behind.  This command can be used to
kill the ghosted client so you can get your
nickname back.  If %b<nickname>%b has %bSET SECURE%b
OFF, and you match a hostmask on %b<nickname>%b's
ACCESS LIST, then you do not need to supply a password.
