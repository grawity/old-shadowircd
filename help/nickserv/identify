Syntax: %bIDENTIFY <password>%b

Most commands require that you identify yourself, in order to
use them.  Also, nicknames which have kill protection will
be killed if the user has not identified within one minute.
If %bSET AUTOMASK%b is ON, and you %bIDENTIFY%b from a host
which is not on your %bACCESS%b list, the new hostmask will
automatically be added to it.
