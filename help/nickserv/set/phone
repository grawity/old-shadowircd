Syntax: %bSET PHONE <PHONE number|->%b

Sets the your PHONE number to <GSM number>. When users perform 
an %bINFO%b on your nickname, they will be informed of 
your PHONE number, unless you set %bHIDE%b ON. 
To clear your PHONE number use a "-" as the parameter.
Examples:
         %b/msg %N SET PHONE +385 1 1234567%b
           Sets your PHONE to "+385 1 1234567".

         %b/msg %N SET PHONE -%b
           Clears your PHONE number.
