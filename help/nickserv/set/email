Syntax: %bSET EMAIL <email address|->%b

Sets the your email address to <email address>.
When users perform an %bINFO%b on your nickname,
they will be informed of the your email address,
unless you set %bHIDE%b ON. To clear your email
address use a "-" as the parameter.
Examples:
         %b/msg %N SET EMAIL me@me.com%b
           Sets your email address to "me@me.com".

         %b/msg %N SET EMAIL -%b
           Clears your email address.
