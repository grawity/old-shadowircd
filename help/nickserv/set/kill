Syntax: %bSET KILL {ON|OFF|IMMED}%b

 This toggles kill protection for your nickname ON/OFF.
If kill protection is on, %N will forcibly remove users
who take your nickname without identifying, unless they
match a hostmask on your %bACCESS%b list.

 If you specify IMMED, users who are not on your access
list will be killed immediately, without a delay. If you
%bSET SECURE%b ON in addition to this option, the user
will be given a one minute delay to identify. Otherwise
they will never get a chance to identify, even if they come
from a known host because of the definition of SET SECURE.

 Use this option carefully. Some administrators may opt
to completely disable SET KILL IMMED.
