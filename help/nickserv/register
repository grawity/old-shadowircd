Syntax: %bREGISTER <password>%b

This enables you to register your nickname with a
password so only you can use it.  Please try to
use obscure passwords that cannot be easily guessed.
Passwords *ARE* case sensitive.  Once you have
registered a nickname, you can use the %bSET%b and
%bACCESS%b commands to configure it.
