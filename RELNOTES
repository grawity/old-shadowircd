  MODULES CREATED FOR ircd-ratbox-1.4-2 AND EARLIER WILL NO LONGER WORK
  WITHOUT MODIFICATION.

  The encap handler has been added before the oper handler - simply add
  "m_ignore," before the oper handler.  You can differentiate between 1.4-2
  and 1.5 style, by testing the define HAVE_ENCAP_HANDLERS.
