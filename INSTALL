INSTALLATION 

 The fast and easy way:

     ./install.fast

   NOTE: If you use this script, you must make sure config.h
         is correctly configured prior to running the script;
         also - using this script will default to installing
         HybServ2 in /usr/local/hybserv/, unless you first edit
         Makefile.in

 In order to compile HybServ2, you should perform the following steps:

    1) Enter the hybserv tree and run ./configure, a GNU configure script,
       which should find whatever it needs for compilation.

    2) Edit include/config.h and change the information to suit your IRC
       Network.  Also, be sure to edit bin/hybserv.conf to set up the
       services to work with your network. (This is the file where you can
       give others access to HybServ2)

    3) Run 'make' in the hybserv tree to compile the package. When make
       finishes, you'll probably want to: 'strip bin/hybserv' to remove
       debugging symbols from the file, since the author is the only one
       who really uses it.  It also decreases the file size greatly.

    4) Finally, become root if necessary, and run 'make install' to
       install HybServ2 on your system.  The default install directory is
       /usr/local/hybserv.  This will automatically chown the install
       directory to the same user who ran the configure script, so it
       won't run as root.  You can change the user by editing Makefile.

    5) You may wish to remove any objects/binaries created during
       installation.  You can do this via 'make clean'.  If you wish to
       remove any configure generated files as well, use 'make distclean'.

	 ** Note: if you want to install HybServ2 in a directory other than
            /usr/local/hybserv, you must run the configure script with 
            the --prefix option.

    For example, if you want to install HybServ2 in /home/mydir:

       ./configure --prefix=/home/mydir
       make
       make install

     Then, HybServ2 will be installed in /home/mydir/hybserv.

  HybServ2 is known to compile cleanly on the following operating systems,
  and may compile on others.

    Linux 2.4.x (and older)
    FreeBSD 4.4 (and older)
    OpenBSD 2.7 (and older)
    Solaris 8 (and older)
    Digital Unix 4.0
    Cygwin 1.1.3 (and newer)

 If you are unable to compile HybServ, please let me know at
 kreator@srce.hr.  Bug reports/suggestions may be sent to the same
 address.  Now, go read the README :-).
