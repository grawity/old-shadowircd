/*
 * Define this ONLY if every server on your network is running some form

 * modes without having to be in the channel. CSr servers do not allow
 * this, so make sure NO servers on your network are running CSr.

 * having the actual server set the modes.  A significant problem with
 * this, is if OPERSERV_NICK gets kicked before it has a chance to
 * complete its job, where if the server set the modes, that is not a
 * concern.  Thus, there's a tradeoff between efficiency and saving TS.
 */

/*
 * Define this to allocate memory for clients/channels/servers in large
 * chunks rather than doing it individually
 * Advantages:
 *   CPU load will be minimized during netsplits/netjoins because instead
 *   of malloc()/free()'ing every client or channel, we will already have
 *   the space allocated ahead of time
 * Disadvantages:
 *    Slightly more memory is used if a portion of the heap is unused.
 *
 * Undefining this can be very dangerous, since bound checking is not
 * performed on new clients' usernames and hostnames. It relies on ircd to
 * make sure the client has a valid hostname. Thus, it is much much safer
 * to leave this defined.

 * this is, the more accurate it can detect the current load.
 *
 * I've noticed that this can cause services to drop into HTM mode on the
