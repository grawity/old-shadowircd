This repository contains old ShadowIRCd source code, obtained from the CVS repository [at BerliOS](http://developer.berlios.de/projects/shadowircd/) <rsync://cvs.berlios.de/shadowircd_cvs> and converted to Git using cvsps/reposurgeon.

Each CVS module, being fairly small, was imported as a separate branch in this repo.
