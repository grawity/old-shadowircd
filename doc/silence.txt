Information on the SILENCE command.
This implementation is done by nenolod.
Silences are added to the list with:

/silence +User!*@* or
/silence +User

If you want a silence on the nickname, i.e. it is a bot who is bugging you:
/silence +AnnoyingBot!*
will work.

To delete a silence, do
/silence -User!*@* or whatever.
