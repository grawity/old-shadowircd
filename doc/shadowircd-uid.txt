ShadowIRCd has an added field right before the IP field in the UID 
statement. This field is either a *, designating that a vhost should be 
generated by the local server, or the VHOST of the user. To enable this 
functionality, add the "UVH" token to your CAPAB statement. 

Alternatively, a server may use the original TS6 client with SETCLOAK by 
NOT specifying the UVH capab. Either way, all servers must be able to 
generate the automatic usercloak as they are not sent to save bandwidth.
