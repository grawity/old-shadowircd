 Starting with version 1.2.0, HybServ has pthread support.  Threads
are very efficient in that one process can have several threads
performing various tasks concurrently.  HybServ will automatically
detect if you have pthread libraries on your system with the
configure script, and compile accordingly.
 If you experience problems running HybServ with pthread support
enabled, it is possible that you do not have a thread-safe system,
or that your pthread libraries are not compatible.  HybServ runs
perfectly (so far) under LinuxThreads, which are shipped with glibc2,
or can be obtained from:

ftp.inria.fr/INRIA/Projects/cristal/Xavier.Leroy/linuxthreads.tar.gz

 Solaris threads have also been reported to work very well
with HybServ.

 I have run HybServ with PMPthreads (Patched MIT Pthreads), and
for the most part it works, with the exception of a few bugs.
The major bug I have found with this distribution of pthreads
is that the telnet service does not work at all, but mostly
everything else is ok. PMPthreads can be obtained from:

www.humanfactor.com/pthreads/mit-pthreads.html

 The original MIT pthreads are very unstable (hence PMPthreads),
and have not been developed (as far as I can tell) for quite a
while. It is strongly recommended you do not run HybServ under
this distribution. MIT pthreads can be obtained from:

ftp://sipb.mit.edu/pub/pthreads/

 If you find HybServ is crashing frequently under your
distribution of pthreads, you should run HybServ without thread
support.  This can be done through the following command:

              ./configure --disable-threads
              OR
              ./configure --enable-threads=no

You can then recompile HybServ, and it will not use the pthread
libraries.

** NOTE: HybServ is known not to perform well under glibc 2.1pre*,
         therefore you may want to consider running without thread
         support if you are not running a stable glibc2 release.
