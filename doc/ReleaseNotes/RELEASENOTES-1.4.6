Release Notes for HybServ 1.4.6
======= ===== === ======= =====

 Two optional directives were added to settings.conf so you
can keep track of your jupes and glines more efficiently.
"GlineFile" and "JupeFile" specify two separate files in
which glines and jupes will be stored in.
 A new feature was also added to hybserv.conf - the
.include directive. This allows you to organize your
configuration lines more efficiently by including
other files which may contain configuration lines. The
example hybserv.conf explains more fully.
