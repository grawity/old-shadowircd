Release Notes for HybServ 1.4.0
======= ===== === ======= =====

There are two significant features added in this version
that everyone should be made aware of.

One: NickServ now has support for linked nicknames. This means
     that you can use many different nicknames, but share
     a common access list, memos, and set options. Thus, you
     do not have to custom configure each one. See the
     LINK, UNLINK, and SHOWLINKS help files on NickServ.

Two: The file "settings.conf" was added, which now contains
     most of the old config.h #defines. For most people,
     the defaults I've set should be fine.

     Advantages:
         1. Most of HybServ's features are now run-time
            configurable, rather than compile-time
            configurable as with the old config.h. This means
            you do not need to recompile HybServ to enable or
            disable many features. In fact, in most cases
            you can enable/disable features by rehashing HybServ.

         2. Before, you had to edit config.h everytime you
            upgraded HybServ to a different version. With
            settings.conf, you can keep your favorite settings
            and features, without re-editing everytime you
            upgrade.

     Disadvantages:
         1. If I ever add new features to settings.conf,
            the settings.conf you have won't contain them.
            However, any new added features will be
            explained in a RELEASENOTES file (similar to
            this one) for the new version of HybServ.
