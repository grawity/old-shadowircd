Release Notes for HybServ 1.5.0
======= ===== === ======= =====

 The administrator "a" flag is no longer the highest
flag in O: lines. The "s" flag was added for "Services
Administrators". The commands they have access to
are more services oriented than irc oriented - such
as rehash, restart, die etc. Read the file doc/README-FLAGS
for more information.

 A new directive (ProxyCheck) was added to settings.conf.
With this enabled, HybServ will perform a wingate proxy
check on each client that connects to the network.
Insecure proxies will be logged and broadcast to +y users
on the partyline. You may also get a list of all proxy
users through OperServ's trace command, using:
TRACE -proxy - Check out the trace helpfile for more
information.
 NOTE: You must have pthreads enabled in HybServ in
       order for this feature to work. HybServ will
       create a thread to do the actual wingate check.
 Also, MaxProxies was added to settings.conf to limit
the number of concurrent proxy checks that will be
performed. In the event of a netjoin, we don't want
services performing hundreds of proxy checks since
it would create a large amount of lag as well as
cpu usage.

 Second, the new directive (MaxLogs) was added to
settings.conf. This allows you to maintain some control
over how big your log files get, or how many of them
you wish to keep. Read the section in settings.conf
for more information.

 Third, the new directive (MaxChansPerUser) was added to
settings.conf. This allows you to control how many channels
a user registers at any one time. Read the section in
settings.conf for more information.

 Fourth, the new directive (NicknameWarn) was added to
settings.conf. This allows you to decide if users should
be warned to identify with NickServ when they first
connect to the network. Read the section in settings.conf
for more information.

 A new administrator command was added to NickServ.
"DROPLINK" allows admins to drop an entire nickname link
without having to drop each nickname in the link individually.
Check out NickServ's help file for more information.

 Many new usermodes have been added to OperServ. Basically,
the +d usermode was broken up into many smaller usermodes.
Use .help umode to get a listing.
