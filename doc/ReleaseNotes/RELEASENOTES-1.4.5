Release Notes for HybServ 1.4.5
======= ===== === ======= =====

 Several new directives were added to settings.conf in this
version. It is not imperative that you upgrade settings.conf,
but it is recommended.

I. MaxClonesWarning
   This directive was previously defined in config.h, but
  this way makes it run time configurable. Defining this directive,
  will cause clones to be given a warning when they exceed MaxClones.

II. LagDetect and MaxPing
   I personally think this is a very neat feature, probably
  because it was the "funnest" thing I've coded in a while :P.
  Anyhow, StatServ now pings all servers on the network every
  minute in order to determine how lagged individual servers
  are. To a degree, it is only accurate if services itself
  is not lagged. StatServ displays all ping information
  when you specify a server using the "SERVER" command. The
  ping replies are displayed to four decimal places :-).
   The command "REFRESH" was added to StatServ so you can
  manually force services to re-ping all servers to update
  the lag information. This command can only be executed by
  administrators.
   The MaxPing directive was added to help services minimize
  lag. If the ping response from services' current hub exceeds
  "MaxPing", services will attempt to switch hub servers.
