Release Notes for HybServ 1.4.2
======= ===== === ======= =====

 A new feature was introduced in this version which unfortunately
is not backwards compatible.  You are now able to custom
configure each service bot's ident.  Thus, a third arguement
is required for the *ServNick directives in settings.conf.  The
example settings.conf fully explains the new feature.  Incidently,
this new feature obsoletes the LowercaseIdent directive.
